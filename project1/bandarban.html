        <p>Nafa-khum (Bengali: নাফাখুম) is a waterfall in Bangladesh on the Remaikree River, a tributary of the Sangu River. It is among the largest waterfalls in the country by volume of water falling. The wild hilly Remaikree river suddenly falls down here about 25–30 feet or 7.62-9.144 meters</p>
        <p>The Buddha Dhatu Jadi is located close to Balaghata town, in Bandarban City, in Bangladesh. Dhatu are the material remains of a holy person, and in this temple the relics belong to Buddha. It is the largest Theravada Buddhist temple in Bangladesh and has the second-largest Buddha statue in the country.</p>
        <p>Boga Lake is the most beautiful natural lake of Bangladesh. It is also known as Bagakain Lake or Baga Lake. This amazing lake is located 18 kilometer away from Ruma Upazilla. Boga Lake is about 15 acres. It is about 2700-3000 feet above sea level. After the monsoon, when the hill becomes lavishly green, this lake turns into a real beauty. The lake is surrounded by mountains screened with thick bamboo bushes. There is no channel for draining the water from the lake. The water is crystal clear with blue shed and under the lake water rocks and boulders can be seen everywhere. Don’t miss the chance to bath and swim in such blue water. You can have a campfire beside the lake.</p>
